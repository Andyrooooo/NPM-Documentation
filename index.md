# What is NPM? What does it do? Why is it an important tool?
#### npm is a package manager consisting of JavaScript software and meta information, and is also the default package manager for Node.js. There are 3 distinct components of npm which are the website, the CLI (Command Line Interface), and the registry. The npm website allows you to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage any other aspects regarding npm. The CLI runs from a terminal and is where most of us will use npm to download and manage our packages. The last main component, the registry, is a large public database that contains all the JavaScript software and meta data. 
#### Essentially when you're using your terminal to download a package from node.js, which by the way is one of the largest communities of libraries, npm will make a request to the registry to find that package for you, once it it found it will download the requested information and meta data associated with it. So, in short, any package request made will be managed by npm.
#### npm is an important tool because of automated dependency and package management. This greatly helps with collaboration and even just for your future self, so anytime you need to get started with the project or another person needs to start on the project they can just use npm to install all the dependencies for it. Another great positive for npm is you can specify what versions your project uses to prevent updates breaking the project.
